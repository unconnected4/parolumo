# <Task title>

## Goal and acceptance
What "done" means, and how it's verified (tests, manual check).

## Current state
A few sentences: where things stand right now. This is what the next agent reads first.

## Done
- <what was completed>, <commit sha(s)>

## Tried and rejected
- <approach>: <why it was dropped>, <evidence: test output, error, doc link>

## Decisions made during this task
- <decision>: <reason>, <alternatives considered>

## Open questions
- <question>, <who should answer: user / next agent>

## Next step
The single most useful thing for the next session to do.

## Session log
<!-- Append one line per session. Never rewrite earlier lines. -->
- <UTC timestamp> <agent name>: <one-line summary>, commits <from-sha>..<to-sha>

## Outcome
<!-- Filled in only when archiving. -->
- Result: <what shipped / why abandoned>, final commit or PR <ref>
- Promoted to durable docs: <which decisions moved to intent.md / docs, with links>
- Retrospective: <what went well or badly in the process: misunderstandings, rework, handoff problems>
